# about my tools

I'm kinda done for without my tools, so getting tools up this week was pretty important. It's good that I have an actual IDE, and am not
coding in a notepad, but i'm sure that I'll need to install more tools down the line. Whatever those may be, I need to be sure I install and thoroughly test those tools,
because I really don't want to run into problems that I fuss over and then the obvious solution was the tools were not right, and not just skill issue.
